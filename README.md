How to use the script 
======================

$.getScript("https://rawgit.com/Desterly/Kissanime-LinkDownload/master/kissanime.js")

Description and usage instructions
======================

If you're a free user on Kissanime and want to download multiple episodes at once, you'd usually have to visit each episode page individually one by one and get the download link again and again 

This app avoids that by basically allowing you to simply go to the main anime page, run the script and automatically get direct download links for all the episodes 

The detailed steps to use this script are as follows - 

##1. Login to Kissanime using your account (make one if needed) 

##2. Go to the main page of the anime you want to download (e.g. Wake up Girls)
